# FlappyBirdAI
Developed Flappy Bird using pygame and neat-python modules which includes all the original features of the game including the bird, pipes, and the base with all the sprites being able to move differently. The game also keep score of what point the bird has reached and what generation of the neural network we are currently looking at. The application works by generating a population of 20 different birds each cycle and determines which birds are most fit to survive a generation and breeds birds similar to it causing every cycle to yield even better birds based on the metric that they survive longer and do not run into pipes. This was done using NEAT-Python which is a method developed for evolving arbitrary neural networks. Enjoy!
